What is Packman?
================
Packman is a basic package manager which aims to provide a unified way to manage modifications for games which do not provide adequate management themselves. Such games include Kerbal Space Program, RimWorld and Emergency 5.

Depending on the configuration for each particular mod, it pulls packages from sources such as GitHub or SpaceDock and then runs a sequence of steps to install them.

File safety
===========
Packman aims to minimise the possibility that files end up in an invalid state:

- If an installation fails to complete, all changes will be rolled back.
- If files are changed externally after installation, these files are considered 'orphans' and will not be deleted upon uninstallation.

There is however still work to be done in this area:

- Power outages or other forced terminations will lead to an invalid state that cannot be automatically recovered from.
- There is no command to deal with orphan files.

What isn't Packman?
===================
Packman is not a dependency management system. Although it would be nice to automatically install dependencies and ensure cross-compatibility, as mods do not have standardised manifests Ã  la package.json, this would require a parallel database of mod dependencies be created and continuously maintained.

This would be a lot of work, introduce consistency issues where said database does not agree with the reality, creates the expectation that installing 100 mods should *just work* and just generally wouldn't be worth it as mod dependency trees tend to be very small anyway.

Quick start
===========
**Note:** At some point, it will be simpler than this - probably a compiled binary with an installer - but **it is not yet intended for general use**.

Install Python 3.9.1:
  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/
Install Poetry:
  :code:`pip install poetry`
On Windows, install Make:
  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
Start Packman:
  :code:`make cli` or :code:`make gui`
Run a command:
  :code:`poetry run python -m packman_cli.cli --help`

Settings
========
Currently, Packman settings are configured using environment variables; see :code:`packman/config.py`.

At some point, this will change to be a configuration file in a more user-friendly format.

Configuring new mods
====================
Currently, mod configurations exist in the form of YAML files in the configs folder.

The schema for mod configurations can be found at :code:`docs/schemas/package_definition.json`.

Contributing
============
All contributions are welcomed with open arms.

See the docs to get started (TODO).
